## Image Info Alt Text

Create a simple page, with a random image of your choosing. Create a small i info icon in the corner of the image. When a user clicks on this icon, show a hovering element, filled with a detailed description for this image, like seen in this [screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/g6xf1).

Bonus points if you program the box to automatically read the text directly from image's alt tag.
