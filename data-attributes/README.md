## Data attributes and Tooltips

Create a page with a long lorem ipsum text. Create a couple of links on random places within this text. Use data attributes to store additional text, and show this text as a mouseover tooltip. Even tho it is possible to do via pure [CSS](https://jsbin.com/qagofoxohe/edit?html,css,output), you should do it via JS.
