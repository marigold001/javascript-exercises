## List object props

Write a JavaScript program to list the properties of a JavaScript object.

So, you can use a for loop to get property names, but just log the names of keys. One by one.

Sample object: 
var student = { 
name : "David Rayy", 
sclass : "VI", 
rollno : 12 };

Sample Output: name,sclass,rollno


## Clone and Invert Object

Write a JavaScript function to get a copy of the object where the keys have become the values and the values the keys.

For example you can use this object. In the end, the cloned object should have inverted keys and values like {23: 'age'}

var student = {

age: 23,

name: Milos,

surname: Lazarevic,

grade: 1,

currentModule: 4300FrontEnd

}

## Objects within Objects

Create a Javascript object "phones" containing 3 different manufacturers, with each manufacturer having 3 different models as sub-objects. Each model should have name of its operating system listed along with it. All the phones should also have 3 colors available, same choice of colors for every phone. The object should contain a method that, upon execution, prompts a user for a manufacturer and lists all available models of that manufacturer, along with all accompanying information of those models onto the html page.
