## Animated Div

Create a div that is vertically centered on a blank page. Style it to your liking. When clicked, for the first time, the button should change its size and colors. Every subsequent click, should animate and move the div 100px to right. [similar to this](https://codepen.io/tylerama/full/AJweKm).

For bonus points, try to prevent the button exiting the viewport.
