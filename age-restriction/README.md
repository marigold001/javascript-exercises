## Age Restriction

You're a bouncer at a bar. Given an age variable, create a conditional that satisfies the following requirements:

If a patron is older than 21, print out "Come on in!".
If a patron is between 18 and 21, print out "Come on in (but no drinking)!".
If a patron is younger than 18, print out "You're too young to be in here!".
If a patron is older than 75, print out "Are you sure you want to be here?".
Bonus: Bar patrons must have an ID if the bouncer is even going to consider what age they are. Hint: Whether the patron has an ID or not can be stored in a hasId variable.
If the patron has an ID, the bouncer will then check if they are of the proper age
If the patron does not have an ID, the bouncer will tell them "No ID, no entry."
