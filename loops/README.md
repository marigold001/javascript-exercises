##Loop Math
Write a for loop that will iterate from 0 to 10. For each iteration of the for loop, it will multiply the number by 9 and log the result (e.g. "2 * 9 = 18")

##Spin 151
Write a Loop that will spin exactly 151 times. Output the amount of spins i only once, on the last loop.

##Odd and Even numbers
Your task is to create a loop that prints out all the odd numbers between 1 and 100...twice! Your solution must be exactly one for loop and one while loop.

Bonus: Try doing this using a single for loop. Make it so that the first iteration of the loop prints out all odd numbers between 1 and 100 but the second iteration of the loop prints out all of the even numbers between 1 and 100

##Cars List
You are presented with an array of cars. Your task is to concatenate and output this array into the DOM, every car on a new line. For this particular part of the assignment, you are allowed to use document.write. You must use a loop for this operation.

Bonus. Export everything as an ordered list?

Bonus 2. Do it withtout a loop, but not one by one?

Bonus 3. Do it without document.write?

##Fruit Array Loop
You have to create an array that will hold 5 different kinds of fruit. After each step, output to the console

Add two more types of fruit to the beginning of the array.
Delete last element from the array.
Add two more to the end of the array
Now you have array with 8 elements - delete element 3 and 4, and replace them with other 2 elements
Create a FOR loop that will output all elements of this array, one by one in the console

##Loop Steps
Write a for loop that gets the computer to count down from 100 until 0 each time decrementing by 5. Print the i every loop, but this time, make sure not to print 0.


##Loops
1.Write a script that asks the user to input 5 numbers (either in 5 prompts or 5 text-boxes) and outputs the smallest number that the user entered.
2.Write a program that prints the values, using loops
10
100
1000
10000
100000
1000000
10000000
100000000
1000000000
10000000000
100000000000
3.Prompt the user for one number (N) and calculate the factorial (N!).
explanation: the factorial of a number N is calculated by this formula N! = N * (N-1) * (N-2) * ... * 2 * 1
for N = 5 the factorial is N! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120
