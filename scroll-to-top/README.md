## Scroll to top

Create a very long lorem ipsum page, and a back to top button which will be fixed to the bottom left of the window, like in the [screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/M7Pcp). Clicking  the button should return the user to the top on the page. Try to animate this movement via [JS](https://codepen.io/alexandr-kazakov/pen/yMRPOR).
