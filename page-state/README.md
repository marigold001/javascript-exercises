## Saving page state in a Cookie

Create a page that will allow a user to input his name and preferred colors of text and background. The values should be stored as cookies, using multiple document.cookie calls.

On the next page reload, if the cookies already exist, the user should instead of the form, be greeted by their name, and the text and background colors should be preset to what the user has previously set.
